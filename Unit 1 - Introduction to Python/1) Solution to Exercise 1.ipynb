There are many other ways of doing this, and probably more efficient ways as well. But what matters here is that your program's output corresponds to what I was asking for in the exercise. Please only look at the solution once you have attempted the exercise or if you are unsure of how to start.\n","\n","Note that I also ran my code and showed an example of the user's experience playing the game. The way I played the game is the solution to Optional Exercise 2. The strategy that ensures you always win this game is to keep guessing the number in the centre of the interval of all possible numbers. This will partition the possibilities in a very efficient way."]},{"metadata":{"id":"lZz9UaZljEjb","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0},"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":238},"outputId":"58da0814-357d-45bf-8bcf-5216daa7f0c8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1529085081082,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":34662,"user":{"displayName":"KC Tsiolis","photoUrl":"//lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jimU3pGTxPI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA6o/BcmsMZzLlOI/s50-c-k-no/photo.jpg","userId":"104202067164552445883"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","\n","secretNumber = random.randint(0,100) #Generates a random integer\n","\n","print(\"Welcome to the Guessing Game!
