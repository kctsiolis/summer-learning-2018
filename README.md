# summer-learning-2018
Code for lectures and exercises of the Summer 2018 machine learning seminar given at Vanier College.

Most of the core material was based off of existing Python code in books by Geron, Marsland, and Raschka. So here I am only including original code.

The full seminar had 8 units:
1) Introduction to Python
2) Multi-Layer Perceptrons
3) Support Vector Machines
4) Principal Component Analysis
5) Evolutionary Learning
6) Reinforcement Learning
7) Deep Learning with Tensorflow
8) Convolutional Neural Networks
